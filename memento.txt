In strcpy man:
BUGS
       If  the  destination  string of a strcpy() is not large enough, then anything might happen.
       Overflowing fixed-length string buffers is a favorite cracker technique for taking complete
       control of the machine.  Any time a program reads or copies data into a buffer, the program
       first needs to check that there's enough space.  This may be unnecessary if  you  can  show
       that  overflow  is  impossible, but be careful: programs can get changed over time, in ways
       that may make the impossible possible.
